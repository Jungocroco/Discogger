# Discoggert

This Git contains all the files for the Discoggert App I made for the final project of the course. The app makes use of the Discogs API which allows developers to use and extract from their comprehensive music database. For this project I made the effort to simulate a search function for users to browse through. The function asks for an artist name whereafter it delivers the corresponding releases.

At the same time, the app makes use of Google's Firebase and updates its online database with the user registration details and Discogs' ID's, resulting from the executed search.

As the result of a surprising deletion of a controller within my project and some poor decisions within the design of my code I couldn't make the 'favourite function' work that I wanted to implement.
